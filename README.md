# INCOME-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT
I will build models to predict a binary variable of whether a given individual in the data earns more, or less than $50,000.  I'll employ a number of different techniques to evaluate the efficiency of the models.  The feature space I'll use to build the models consists of the following 11 features. Age: The age of an individual. Workclass: The sector of the economy in which the individual is employed. Fnlwgt: A continuious measure which denotes the socio-economic condition of the individual. Education Number: Education level completed. Marital Status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse. Relationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried Race: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black. Sex: Male, Female. Capital gains: Continuous value of cappital gain received that year. Capital Loss: Continuous value of cappital loss incurred that year. Hours Per Week: Number of hours subject worked per week.  The dataset included in this depository was originally drawn from the 1994 Census Bureau Database and provided by Kaggle.com.
